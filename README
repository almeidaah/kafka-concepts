* This is just an experimental project using producer and consumers of kafka.
* In resources folder are many commands of how to use kafka by commandline(kafka default cli)

There are 3 approaches on how to use kafka prod/consumer in this project:

1. Simple producer / consumer
2. Producer using keys to allocate messages to always-same-partition
3. Producer/consumer using threads/callbacks

There is also a ConsumerDemoGroups that uses an specific group to read earliest messages.
